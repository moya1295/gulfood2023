From passionate artisans to an international organisation, our company has always looked to the future, staying true to the family motto: “Boundaries do not exist”. From the lands of the Emilia-Romagna region to overseas markets, Balsamic Vinegar of Modena has taken its place as the Italian condiment par excellence. This success was consolidated over the years to follow, when the running of the company passed to his son Marcello, who succeeded in launching De Nigris’s products onto the international market and in widening the product range to include the prestigious Balsamic vinegar. A spirit of innovation that, thanks to the third generation of Master Vinegar Makers, still guides us today and allows us to offer our clients products of excellence, which are appreciated world-wide for their quality and creativity."

The company takes its name from the spring of the same name, which has been known since the times of the Venetian Republic as an ‘Ancient Spring of Health’, its waters much sought-after by Venetian families for its healing properties. San Benedetto soon grew from a small local producer into a company with a nationwide scope operating the length and breadth of Italy, with strong interests also beyond its national borders. Today, it is an ‘all embracing’ group with multiple specialisations and channels, that operates successfully in all segments of non-alcoholic beverages. The company has always upheld its verve for innovation, technology and service, product and process, thanks to which it has achieved leadership not only in numbers, but also in its ideas and their applications, which succeed in meeting the real needs of consumers.

It all began when Ilias Alexakis, the father of the present owner, started learning the traditional technique for making pita bread for souvlaki at a specialist bakery in the Piraeus suburb of Drapetsona. Eventually, all Ilias’s hard work paid off, and he used the experience and knowledge he had gained to open his own business in the early 1980s. Since then, the company has grown steadily, consistently increasing production and sales to become one of the foremost producers of pita bread in Greece, its name synonymous with commitment to quality. After 45 years of ceaseless work, the time came for Ilias to make way for the next generation. So in 1996, the family business was handed on to Ioannis Alexakis, who was already extremely experienced, having worked for the company from an early age. With an eye to the future, and encouraged by his father, who continued to take an active interest in the business, Ioannis worked tirelessly to expand the company. By 2003, it had become clear that the steady growth in demand both in Greece and abroad had made another expansion necessary. New, modern equipment was acquired, for significantly increased output, and at the same time, the computerisation of the whole company began. In 2020, Alexakis moved to new, bigger premises, covering 11000 square metres, at the Menidi Industrial Park in Acharnes, putting the company in the perfect position to combine traditional values with a state-of-the-art production process. In addition to the general modernisation of buildings and equipment, the company has put in place a certified food safety management system IFS ,HALAL."

Unlike conventional Spirulina, it does not contain the distinct taste, and does not interfere with the original taste of the food. This means that you can mix tabérumo with juice, smoothie, dessert and even pasta to supplement vitamins and proteins! Furthermore, Spirulina is rich in protein (70% in dry weight), considered as the great candidate for meat alternatives, while capturing CO2 to contribute decarbonisation and sustainability. What is more surprising, spirulina and other microalgae can become raw materials for fuel, plastics and cosmetics too. tabérumo is the product and company name, started as a part of CHITOSE Laboratory’s technology and business development.

With hard work, the small unit quickly expands throughout the Peloponnese and to the rapidly growing market of Athens, which is located less than two hundred kilometers away. The supply of olive oil is slowly differentiating. The olive oil used is from all over the Peloponnese, but also from other areas outside of it, and thus, all qualities are covered. Until 1985, the company deals exclusively with olive oil. From that year, the sons of Il. Foufas, George and Othonas, enter the company and the second phase of its development begins. With continuous investments, of which the two main took place in 1987 and 1990, the company initially gains nationwide fame and then expands to foreign markets. At the same time, it expands its product line to include a wide variety of seed oils. In 2012, the third generation actively enters the business and a new cycle of investments begins. The company greatly expands its clientele in foreign countries and at the same time, it strengthens its collaborations in Greece, which are the solid foundations for its further development."

JAF TEA is currently sold in over 30 countries across the globe and we are growing rapidly as more and more customers discover the exceptional quality of our products. Our single origin products showcase the specialty nature of each tea region, with a strong emphasis on Ceylon Orthodox black tea. Unique agricultural climates and the expert skills of the tea makers mean that Ceylon black tea is recognised as the finest in the world. We only accept the very best and our 70 years’ experience means that we really know our tea. Our team of skilled tasters assess over 10,000 lots of tea every week to make sure we are choosing only the finest. Tea tastes best when it is fresh as it quickly loses its inherent quality with time, significantly affecting the aroma and flavour. Our production facilities in Colombo are close to where our Ceylon teas are grown, so we can pack them within days of harvesting to preserve their unique flavour and aroma. Our facilities are also BRC, ISO 9001 and FSSC 22000 certified. We offer a variety of black, green, oolong, flavoured and white teas. You can buy our tea as loose leaf or convenient tea bags. As a family owned business, ethical considerations are an integral part of our decision-making process. We believe that to have a truly sustainable Ceylon tea industry, our teas should be packed in Sri Lanka. This helps us to support local communities and deliver our tea in its purest form to our customers around the world."

The youngest frontal folds of the Himalayas contain pre Cambrian age deposits of evaporated ancient seas which have been preserved by nature in the form of Himalayan Pink salt.

I was amazed by the world of bees. Creating a bee colony and monitoring the way this world grows and survives, was something truly spectacular. Without a beekeeping heritage running in our family, I had to learn the old-fashioned way. This meant helping former, experienced beekeepers. In this way, I was able to closely observe the process of integrated production and I was by far more fascinated by the process of beekeeping. I was also able to realize the way a product is created from scratch, and, even more, the way I can achieve this, in collaboration with nature! Later on, in my 20s (2015), I decided that this should be my main occupation. In order to achieve this, I attended a series of courses and seminars on beekeeping, of ered by the Beekeeping Laboratory of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, along with my studies in Agricultural Technology. After 9 years of commitment and having the necessary expertise in the field, our team manages to produce honey in suf icient quantity and is always driven by excellent quality. Our need for evolution and our external thoughts resulted in the creation of a new brand, which goes by the name of “Philomelia ” (2020). A brand that from the very first moment was welcomed and embraced by the local community and was also distinguished in an international and acknowledged tasting competition conducted in England (Great Taste Awards). At the same time, we are currently constructing our new honey packing plant, which will complete our journey of production. From day one till today, everything has fitted together perfectly. In slow, but steady steps we walk our way into our dreams and look towards the future with great optimism."

Being an important part of Pompous Group, the company can enjoy several resources, such as a stable cash flow, modern infrastructure and an in-depth understanding about social, political climate of the country in which it places facilities. This paves its way to an easy market dominance. At the moment, PSL is proud to be the only company in Vietnam with the ability to source from Africa. It is because we own representative offices and warehouses on this continent, in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast for specific. Aside from experts sent from the headquarters, almost all of the employees there are the locals, who comprehend their homeland, helping us access regions where cashews are grown in the best conditions. Moreover, instead of trading via brokers, we buy raw cashews directly from farmers, which allows us to not only better control the input but also offer the farmers the best price. The best success that PSL has achieved since establishment is probably the development of a fully vertical integrated supply chain. The whole process, from sourcing, storage, transporting to manufacturing and distributing is closely managed by our collaborators. This is the firm ground for us to pursue the target of full traceability for each and every product by 2025. At the same time, the company puts emphasis on ESG investing. Apart from the supply from Africa, PSL operates an Organic farm in Cambodia. Although it can run with full capacity to fulfill bookings, our factories in Binh Phuoc always follow strict standards to minimize their effects on the environment."

The founder Antonio Quaranta, together with his wife Alzira, was a passionate artisanal producer of nougat and other typical, traditional sweets from Cremona and Bergamo, including cotton candy, brittle and the special nougat with carob honey. A small laboratory in the heart of Caravaggio was the place that gave birth to the recipe book reporting precise details on amounts and ingredients, some of which are still used in production nowadays: after almost 100 years, our original ""White nougat 101"" almond soft nougat’s recipe has never changed! We were the first and passionate creators of the Nougat Passion® concept: starting from the original recipe written in 1925 by the founder Antonio Quaranta we created a new and seductive idea of nougat: combine - with artisan passion - real pastry creams, jams, biscuits and much more to the cozy softness of our nougat.

In 1992, and due to the growing demand for Siniora’s superior-quality delicatessen meat products, a factory was established in Sahab, Jordan, under the name of Siniora Food Industries. After decades of success, in 1996, the Arab Palestinian Investment Company (APIC) acquired Siniora’s two branches. Through APIC’s substantial investments, Siniora witnessed an exponential increase in resources and capacities that allowed it to add new product lines and integrate the latest technologies that exceeded the highest standards of quality in food production, supplying markets beyond Jordan and Palestine into Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Omar, Yemen and Bahrain. Today, Siniora operates some of the most advanced factories in the world within the processed meat industry. In 2011, the company bought Unium, consolidating Siniora Food Industries as the dominant market leader within Jordan and Palestine for both canned meats and cold cuts. In 2015, production lines were upgraded to include frozen foods, which complement the company’s large assortment of cold cuts and canned meat, including mortadella, turkey, roasted meats, luncheon meats, salami, sausages, canned meats, frozen meats. In 2016, Siniora acquired the Dubai-based Diamond Meat Processing Company (Al-Masa) located in UAE, a move that further increased the company’s reach in the GCC market. In 2021 Siniora acquired the Turkish company” Tarakya company for the manufacture and trade of meat” with a brand called “Polonez” to add a new Milestone in its growth strategy to tackle new markets. By 2021 Siniora expanded product portfolio to satisfy the diversified needs of customers and produced “Badeel” Gluten free and soya free plant – based brand."

While the rest of the world was super-sizing their apples, we did the opposite. From Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand we created the world’s one-of-a-kind, perfectly-sized small apple and packed it with concentrated flavour and goodness. Then we thought different again and created unique, premium packaging to disrupt the category and stand out on shelves. Our apples are now sold in more than 30 countries around the world – and grown in 8, which means they’re fresh all year around. In a world of sameness, different is how we stand out and get ahead. Pioneering and innovating. Faster, greater, fresher. We’ve got a winning difference – and big ambitions to be the world’s most loved apple brand. And in true Rockit style, we’re making this happen in our own unique way. This is how we’re inspiring people around the world to love an apple that’s just that little bit different, and to take on the world one bite at a time, in their own way. To Rockit every day."

Venkatachalapathy, Swastiks was formed with an ambitious vision to be one of the leading Food Processing Industry by providing products made under good manufacturing practices and offered at competitive prices. By providing products of taste and value over the years, Swastiks Products have carved a niche for itself in the food industry and have succeeded in gaining trust of consumers & traders alike and have maintained faith for the past five decades. Swastiks grew slowly but steadily thanks to the vision, quality consciousness and keen business acumen of our Founder, A.C Venkatachalapathy. Knowing fully well that the housewife would insist on preparing food for her family only with the purest of ingredients, he personally sourced the spices that went into the powders. Gradually we developed a growing base of loyal customers, who trusted only our products for their kitchen. In 1984 we opened our first factory and there was no looking back. Over the next four decades Swastiks has grown into a Rs. 350 crore FMCG company and one of the leading packaged food brands in South India. Today, we have ten manufacturing units, a centralized modern packaging unit and a team of more than 1000 committed employees. All of which works to provide India's discerning consumers with a rich portfolio of high quality food products through a network of about 1000 dealers. What began as a family business operating out of the Founder's house is now a professionally managed corporate house that works with the same values that our Founder instilled in us at inception. Swastiks is not just a household word but an indispensable and much loved member of every home."
