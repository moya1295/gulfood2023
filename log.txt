From passionate artisans to an international organisation, our company has always looked to the future, staying true to the family motto: “Boundaries do not exist”. From the lands of the Emilia-Romagna region to overseas markets, Balsamic Vinegar of Modena has taken its place as the Italian condiment par excellence. This success was consolidated over the years to follow, when the running of the company passed to his son Marcello, who succeeded in launching De Nigris’s products onto the international market and in widening the product range to include the prestigious Balsamic vinegar. A spirit of innovation that, thanks to the third generation of Master Vinegar Makers, still guides us today and allows us to offer our clients products of excellence, which are appreciated world-wide for their quality and creativity.'}

The company takes its name from the spring of the same name, which has been known since the times of the Venetian Republic as an ‘Ancient Spring of Health’, its waters much sought-after by Venetian families for its healing properties. San Benedetto soon grew from a small local producer into a company with a nationwide scope operating the length and breadth of Italy, with strong interests also beyond its national borders. Today, it is an ‘all embracing’ group with multiple specialisations and channels, that operates successfully in all segments of non-alcoholic beverages. The company has always upheld its verve for innovation, technology and service, product and process, thanks to which it has achieved leadership not only in numbers, but also in its ideas and their applications, which succeed in meeting the real needs of consumers. San Benedetto Group is the leading Italian-owned company in the market and it is active in over 100 Countries.'}

It all began when Ilias Alexakis, the father of the present owner, started learning the traditional technique for making pita bread for souvlaki at a specialist bakery in the Piraeus suburb of Drapetsona. Eventually, all Ilias’s hard work paid off, and he used the experience and knowledge he had gained to open his own business in the early 1980s. Since then, the company has grown steadily, consistently increasing production and sales to become one of the foremost producers of pita bread in Greece, its name synonymous with commitment to quality. After 45 years of ceaseless work, the time came for Ilias to make way for the next generation. So in 1996, the family business was handed on to Ioannis Alexakis, who was already extremely experienced, having worked for the company from an early age. With an eye to the future, and encouraged by his father, who continued to take an active interest in the business, Ioannis worked tirelessly to expand the company. By 2003, it had become clear that the steady growth in demand both in Greece and abroad had made another expansion necessary. New, modern equipment was acquired, for significantly increased output, and at the same time, the computerisation of the whole company began. In 2020, Alexakis moved to new, bigger premises, covering 11000 square metres, at the Menidi Industrial Park in Acharnes, putting the company in the perfect position to combine traditional values with a state-of-the-art production process. In addition to the general modernisation of buildings and equipment, the company has put in place a certified food safety management system IFS ,HALAL.'}

Caffè Mauro roastery was founded in 1949 by Demetrio Mauro and in 2022 it was purchased by the GIMOKA Group. 60 employees work in the 6,000 square meters headquarters overlooking the beautiful Strait of Messina, surrounded by a green park of 35,000 square meters. A NEW COFFEE CULTURE Today, as in 1949, the blends for the perfect espresso are chosen among the best worldwide varieties of Arabica and Robusta. The origins are wisely processed one by one, as is done for everything that is special, without haste. The new range of Caffè Mauro blends is the result of a careful analysis of consumers’ habits, especially of those consumers who like to increase their purchase awareness through transparency of coffee information in order to choose between different combinations of origins, according to their own tastes and different moments of consumption. The new Arabica and Robusta coffee percentages become the new blend names, transparently declared on every single package, along with the product origin, the intensity of the taste, the roasting level and the caffeine content. With this repositioning, Caffè Mauro aims to start a cultural change in the world of coffee.'}

Furthermore, Spirulina is rich in protein (70% in dry weight), considered as the great candidate for meat alternatives, while capturing CO2 to contribute decarbonisation and sustainability.

These are the numbers of Coind, an industrial group founded in 1961 in Castel Maggiore, in the province of Bologna, which today is a solid business of national importance, recognized for quality, responsibility and efficiency. It is a success story marked by a strong motivation to innovation. With a total of 7,000 tonnes of coffee roasted every year, the company is a leader in Italy in the production of private label coffee for retail and it’s proud to also have an international presence in over 60 countries. Coind can satisfy all customer needs in the roasted coffee sector, creating ad-hoc blends (100 percent Arabica blends, single origins, decaffeinated, certified coffees…) in any packaging type (ground coffee, whole beans, capsules, pods…) The company uses over 50 different types of green coffee from 20 countries of origin. The quality is guaranteed by over 11.000 inspections every year, made both internally and in external laboratories. Coind’s controls begin in the countries of origin, where the company experts carefully select the best Arabica & Robusta green coffees, cultivated by producers with whom the company has developed a strong partnership over time. The tests continue all along the production process, with an extremely technological factory that – from roasting to packaging – allows the company to guarantee application of its high quality standards, in conformity with the main quality certifications, such as ISO, BRC and IFS.'}

A part of our family moved to Delhi in 1950 and established a small outlet in the historic Chandni Chowk Bazar of Old Delhi. Lovingly people started calling us BIKANERVALA, referring to our roots in the city of Bikaner in Rajasthan. Thus, came into being a brand that has now grown into a major global player in the arena of Ethnic Indian Food, Sweets, and Snacks. With over 100 mega outlets and a vast range of packaging products which today have a presence across the world. In 1990, we diversified into the business of packaged food with the brand 'Bikano' and pioneered the art of blending traditional taste in a modern form through state-of-the-art technology. Today, we have a wide range of Namkeen, Snacks, Sweets, Papad, Frozen Range and Syrups, etc. All these are manufactured in fully automated plants. We serve true authentic recipes to the consumer in the form of packaged food. Taste, hygiene, and quality is our connecting factor with our consumers. We strive to provide value-for-money products to our customers and have expanded its footprints not only in the country but also established its name across the globe. Our vast distribution network of more than 3,000 channel partners and huge retailer base has ensured the reach of Bikano products to every nook and corner of the nation. Apart from that, we have also marked our presence on the international map by exporting to more than 45 countries among which major ones are the USA, Europe, Asia, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, etc."}

The know how to produce these cheeses has been developed over decades thanks to a great commitment of the family owner of the company, of the dairy man working there and it is based on the tradition shared by word of mouth by generations. Our cheese making process utilises artisanal techniques in small vats, which allows us to handle the curd manually with delicacy, and pay necessary attention in order to respect the natural timing of the milk."}

Oth. Foufas established a small olive oil packaging and standardization company in Doliana, Kynouria, on the sunny shores of the Argolic Gulf. In accordance with the longstanding Greek tradition, he establishes a high quality unit, in order to cover the needs of the local market and the areas around the flatland of Thyreatikos. With hard work, the small unit quickly expands throughout the Peloponnese and to the rapidly growing market of Athens, which is located less than two hundred kilometers away. The supply of olive oil is slowly differentiating. The olive oil used is from all over the Peloponnese, but also from other areas outside of it, and thus, all qualities are covered. Until 1985, the company deals exclusively with olive oil. From that year, the sons of Il. Foufas, George and Othonas, enter the company and the second phase of its development begins. With continuous investments, of which the two main took place in 1987 and 1990, the company initially gains nationwide fame and then expands to foreign markets. At the same time, it expands its product line to include a wide variety of seed oils. In 2012, the third generation actively enters the business and a new cycle of investments begins. The company greatly expands its clientele in foreign countries and at the same time, it strengthens its collaborations in Greece, which are the solid foundations for its further development.'}

Beyond the legal requirements, there are additional aspects of product quality, which are also valued by consumers, e.g. the use of traditional farming methods in production. Food safety: The main objective of the European Commission's food safety policy is to ensure a high level of protection of human health and consumer interests relating to food, taking also into account the diversity and the effective functioning of the external market. Strict EU rules were tightened in 2000 to ensure that European food is extremely safe. Green Deal: The European Green Deal sets out how to make Europe the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. It maps a new, sustainable and inclusive growth strategy to boost the economy, improve people's health and quality of life, care for nature, and leave no one behind.

From its inception in 1944, it has built a reputation for superb quality and exquisite taste. We are proud to select, package and market all our teas. JAF TEA is currently sold in over 30 countries across the globe and we are growing rapidly as more and more customers discover the exceptional quality of our products. Our single origin products showcase the specialty nature of each tea region, with a strong emphasis on Ceylon Orthodox black tea. Unique agricultural climates and the expert skills of the tea makers mean that Ceylon black tea is recognised as the finest in the world. We only accept the very best and our 70 years’ experience means that we really know our tea. Our team of skilled tasters assess over 10,000 lots of tea every week to make sure we are choosing only the finest. Tea tastes best when it is fresh as it quickly loses its inherent quality with time, significantly affecting the aroma and flavour. Our production facilities in Colombo are close to where our Ceylon teas are grown, so we can pack them within days of harvesting to preserve their unique flavour and aroma. Our facilities are also BRC, ISO 9001 and FSSC 22000 certified. We offer a variety of black, green, oolong, flavoured and white teas. You can buy our tea as loose leaf or convenient tea bags. As a family owned business, ethical considerations are an integral part of our decision-making process. We believe that to have a truly sustainable Ceylon tea industry, our teas should be packed in Sri Lanka. This helps us to support local communities and deliver our tea in its purest form to our customers around the world.'}

Another unique feature of this range is that while the mountain beds contain salts and a wealth of minerals, the rolling greens and valleys are rich with flora and fauna and dotted with nectar and pollen bearing trees and herbs. We firmly believe in sustainably sourcing our products and in pursuance of this vision we started one of the largest apiculture extension initiative, one of its kind, to support the adaption of modern beekeeping practices by beekeepers all across Pakistan. The youngest frontal folds of the Himalayas contain pre Cambrian age deposits of evaporated ancient seas which have been preserved by nature in the form of Himalayan Pink salt. We offer our sustainably sourced all Natural Health and wellness products to customers across the world with a vision and a promise that we will keep our products in their natural state. We believe that denaturing and extensive processing of food has depleted its functionality to heal and rejuvenate. We at the Himalayan wellness Co have taken it upon us to ensure that a truly delectable, wholesome and nutritious experience is delivered to our customers globally.'}

Brugnoli family's managerial policy, marked by creativity, professional dedication and the constant quest for quality, has allowed the company to reach goals ever more ambitious and important. Today, La Rustichella has become one of the market leaders in truffles. Truffle harvesting has its roots not only in the ancient traditions of Italy but in those of Brugnoli family as well. While it is a continual challenge to follow these ancient traditions with honesty, passion and professionalism, always with great respect for Mother Nature, we strive each day to do so. The resulting product of our philosophy is “La Rustichella Truffles” With our brand, we bring to you the fragrance, the flavors and the colors of our very generous land. All of our products are harvested, processed and packaged in our country: Italy."}

Our CEO Dr. Nakayama has a 25-year career as a pharmacist, runs a dispensing pharmacy, and is also a university lecturer as a Ph.D ,Pharmaceutical science. Based on our daily interactions with patients and our wealth of knowledge, we select wild herbs that are gentle and mild to the body. We advocate not only chemical medicines, but also traditional herbal health methods. In fact, when patients at a dispensing pharmacy took our matcha, they were able to reduce the use of sleeping pills, hypertensive drugs, diabetes, pain relievers, laxatives, and even chinese herbal medicines. And some of them could reduce their weight. When we conducted a monitor test before launching a new product, we found that more than 80 percent of people showed improvement. Herbal matcha can be expected not only to be effective, but also to be nutritious. Chlorophyll, which is the source of green, many polyphenols, vitamins and minerals, dietary fiber, such basic nutrients can be taken. Herbs contain more vitamins and minerals than vegetables.

The milk, of Luxembourg origin, is collected by Luxlait tankers from human-scale farms and then transported to the dairy where it will be processed into products such as milk, cream, butter, ice cream, fermented milk, cheese, dairy drinks and niche products from around the world. Luxlait produces almost all the products consumers can expect from a dairy. Controlling all stages of the production chain allows Luxlait to guarantee its consumers flawless traceability. Nearly 1,500 analyses per day are carried out in its in-house laboratory and Luxlait meets the most stringent international requirements of the agri-food industry, which has earned it ISO 22.000, IFS Food, BIO, halal and kosher certification. The high quality standards of its products remain at the heart its corporate strategy but in order to meet the growing expectations of its consumers, Luxlait decided a few years ago to produce in a different way and redefine its corporate values : eco-responsibility, agricultural cooperative, animal welfare and sustainability. “Being good is no longer enough, we strive to be the best” – Gilles Gerard CEO'}

The manufacturing experience gained through the production of packaged pharmaceuticals, as well as and pharmaceutical raw materials, allowed the group to enter the biotechnology industry when the first baker’s yeast plant in Turkey started production in 1973 at Kosekoy, Kocaeli, about 100 km from Istanbul. he brand name Pakmaya became synonymous with industrial yeast, which in turn revolutionized the way bakeries made bread. To meet the ever-increasing demand, a second production plant was built at Izmir-Kemalpasa in 1986, and a third at Duzce-Cumayeri in 1990. A fourth baker’s yeast plant was established in Pascani, Romania in 1998 to serve the East European market. All Pakmaya plants conform to the highest level of international hygiene and quality standards, using all-computerized systems for production, accounting, warehousing and delivery. An experienced team of around 1,000 people produce fresh, active dry and instant yeast varieties in Pakmaya plants. State-of-the-art machinery and equipment is used to ensure highest possible quality and hygiene standards.'}

I was amazed by the world of bees. Creating a bee colony and monitoring the way this world grows and survives, was something truly spectacular. Without a beekeeping heritage running in our family, I had to learn the old-fashioned way. This meant helping former, experienced beekeepers. In this way, I was able to closely observe the process of integrated production and I was by far more fascinated by the process of beekeeping. I was also able to realize the way a product is created from scratch, and, even more, the way I can achieve this, in collaboration with nature! Later on, in my 20s (2015), I decided that this should be my main occupation. In order to achieve this, I attended a series of courses and seminars on beekeeping, of ered by the Beekeeping Laboratory of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, along with my studies in Agricultural Technology. After 9 years of commitment and having the necessary expertise in the field, our team manages to produce honey in suf icient quantity and is always driven by excellent quality. Our need for evolution and our external thoughts resulted in the creation of a new brand, which goes by the name of “Philomelia ” (2020). A brand that from the very first moment was welcomed and embraced by the local community and was also distinguished in an international and acknowledged tasting competition conducted in England (Great Taste Awards). At the same time, we are currently constructing our new honey packing plant, which will complete our journey of production. From day one till today, everything has fitted together perfectly. In slow, but steady steps we walk our way into our dreams and look towards the future with great optimism.'}

Being an important part of Pompous Group, the company can enjoy several resources, such as a stable cash flow, modern infrastructure and an in-depth understanding about social, political climate of the country in which it places facilities. This paves its way to an easy market dominance. At the moment, PSL is proud to be the only company in Vietnam with the ability to source from Africa. It is because we own representative offices and warehouses on this continent, in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast for specific. Aside from experts sent from the headquarters, almost all of the employees there are the locals, who comprehend their homeland, helping us access regions where cashews are grown in the best conditions. Moreover, instead of trading via brokers, we buy raw cashews directly from farmers, which allows us to not only better control the input but also offer the farmers the best price. The best success that PSL has achieved since establishment is probably the development of a fully vertical integrated supply chain. The whole process, from sourcing, storage, transporting to manufacturing and distributing is closely managed by our collaborators. This is the firm ground for us to pursue the target of full traceability for each and every product by 2025. At the same time, the company puts emphasis on ESG investing. Apart from the supply from Africa, PSL operates an Organic farm in Cambodia. Although it can run with full capacity to fulfill bookings, our factories in Binh Phuoc always follow strict standards to minimize their effects on the environment.'}

Almost a century of tradition and dedication. The founder Antonio Quaranta, together with his wife Alzira, was a passionate artisanal producer of nougat and other typical, traditional sweets from Cremona and Bergamo, including cotton candy, brittle and the special nougat with carob honey. A small laboratory in the heart of Caravaggio was the place that gave birth to the recipe book reporting precise details on amounts and ingredients, some of which are still used in production nowadays: after almost 100 years, our original "White nougat 101" almond soft nougat’s recipe has never changed! We were the first and passionate creators of the Nougat Passion® concept: starting from the original recipe written in 1925 by the founder Antonio Quaranta we created a new and seductive idea of nougat: combine - with artisan passion - real pastry creams, jams, biscuits and much more to the cozy softness of our nougat. Even the packaging and the presentation of these products has followed this intuition renewing itself in an attractive, minimal and effective guise.'}

We are an ISO 22000:2018 Certified Company, with a vision to spread the aroma of Green Cardamom to the world. Emperor Akbar is exported to about 25 countries across the globe. Centuries ago, the King of Travancore ensured that only the foremost quality cardamoms were reserved for export from the seaport of Alleppey. This was the beginning of the quality standards of cardamom that became renowned globally as Alleppey Green Cardamom. Samex India has been setting the standards for the industry through its innovative approach. We pioneered the launch of aroma-lock packaging which retains the legendary aroma of cardamom till it reaches the kitchen of the consumer across the world. Our quality-based, colour-coded, standardized grading and packaging of cardamoms to meet the different needs of our consumers across market segments has now become the industry standard. Constantly innovating to meet the spoken and unspoken needs of our consumers and channel partners is the driving force for all our actions. Some of our innovations are: UV-coated textured cartons to retain their attraction over long and rugged terrains; replacing black plastic with a special paper lining inside the cartons to be more environmentally-friendly and to prevent the loss in colour of cardamoms; the batchwise traceability of every packet; tamper-proof resealable zipper packs to prevent adulteration; and sustainable bio-degradable packs in a range of pack sizes to cater to every industry and retail segment. Discerning chefs and foodies know that Emperor Akbar Cardamoms enrich the flavours of biryanis, curries, coffee, kahwa, chai, sweets, bakes, desserts, mouth fresheners and so many more food and beverage options worldwide. No wonder, Emperor Akbar has emerged as the World's Favourite Cardamom."}

In 1992, and due to the growing demand for Siniora’s superior-quality delicatessen meat products, a factory was established in Sahab, Jordan, under the name of Siniora Food Industries. After decades of success, in 1996, the Arab Palestinian Investment Company (APIC) acquired Siniora’s two branches. Through APIC’s substantial investments, Siniora witnessed an exponential increase in resources and capacities that allowed it to add new product lines and integrate the latest technologies that exceeded the highest standards of quality in food production, supplying markets beyond Jordan and Palestine into Syria, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Qatar, Omar, Yemen and Bahrain. Today, Siniora operates some of the most advanced factories in the world within the processed meat industry. In 2011, the company bought Unium, consolidating Siniora Food Industries as the dominant market leader within Jordan and Palestine for both canned meats and cold cuts. In 2015, production lines were upgraded to include frozen foods, which complement the company’s large assortment of cold cuts and canned meat, including mortadella, turkey, roasted meats, luncheon meats, salami, sausages, canned meats, frozen meats. In 2016, Siniora acquired the Dubai-based Diamond Meat Processing Company (Al-Masa) located in UAE, a move that further increased the company’s reach in the GCC market. In 2021 Siniora acquired the Turkish company” Tarakya company for the manufacture and trade of meat” with a brand called “Polonez” to add a new Milestone in its growth strategy to tackle new markets. By 2021 Siniora expanded product portfolio to satisfy the diversified needs of customers and produced “Badeel” Gluten free and soya free plant – based brand."}

While the rest of the world was super-sizing their apples, we did the opposite. From Hawke’s Bay, New Zealand we created the world’s one-of-a-kind, perfectly-sized small apple and packed it with concentrated flavour and goodness. Then we thought different again and created unique, premium packaging to disrupt the category and stand out on shelves. Our apples are now sold in more than 30 countries around the world – and grown in 8, which means they’re fresh all year around. In a world of sameness, different is how we stand out and get ahead. Pioneering and innovating. Faster, greater, fresher. We’ve got a winning difference – and big ambitions to be the world’s most loved apple brand. And in true Rockit style, we’re making this happen in our own unique way. This is how we’re inspiring people around the world to love an apple that’s just that little bit different, and to take on the world one bite at a time, in their own way. To Rockit every day.'}

Swastiks grew slowly but steadily thanks to the vision, quality consciousness and keen business acumen of our Founder, A.C Venkatachalapathy. Knowing fully well that the housewife would insist on preparing food for her family only with the purest of ingredients, he personally sourced the spices that went into the powders. Gradually we developed a growing base of loyal customers, who trusted only our products for their kitchen. In 1984 we opened our first factory and there was no looking back. Over the next four decades Swastiks has grown into a Rs. 350 crore FMCG company and one of the leading packaged food brands in South India. Today, we have ten manufacturing units, a centralized modern packaging unit and a team of more than 1000 committed employees. All of which works to provide India's discerning consumers with a rich portfolio of high quality food products through a network of about 1000 dealers. What began as a family business operating out of the Founder's house is now a professionally managed corporate house that works with the same values that our Founder instilled in us at inception. Swastiks is not just a household word but an indispensable and much loved member of every home."}
