It all began when Ilias Alexakis, the father of the present owner, started learning the traditional technique for making pita bread for souvlaki at a specialist bakery in the Piraeus suburb of Drapetsona. Eventually, all Ilias’s hard work paid off, and he used the experience and knowledge he had gained to open his own business in the early 1980s. Since then, the company has grown steadily, consistently increasing production and sales to become one of the foremost producers of pita bread in Greece, its name synonymous with commitment to quality. After 45 years of ceaseless work, the time came for Ilias to make way for the next generation. So in 1996, the family business was handed on to Ioannis Alexakis, who was already extremely experienced, having worked for the company from an early age. With an eye to the future, and encouraged by his father, who continued to take an active interest in the business, Ioannis worked tirelessly to expand the company. By 2003, it had become clear that the steady growth in demand both in Greece and abroad had made another expansion necessary. New, modern equipment was acquired, for significantly increased output, and at the same time, the computerisation of the whole company began. In 2020, Alexakis moved to new, bigger premises, covering 11000 square metres, at the Menidi Industrial Park in Acharnes, putting the company in the perfect position to combine traditional values with a state-of-the-art production process. In addition to the general modernisation of buildings and equipment, the company has put in place a certified food safety management system IFS ,HALAL."

Anywhere, any time. Canelli. This is where it all began and where everything continues today. Six generations later. In exactly the same way. A story that is always told in the present tense. Today, Pia, Gigi and Polina are at the helm of the company. They give Bosca a new look and do so by bravely putting themselves on the line. With them, a new, original chapter is born. A chapter that stems out once again from the desire to go against the tide, aiming to reveal new ways of experiencing sparkling wines, transforming the well-established ritual of toasting into a new and unconventional experience that can be enjoyed every day, by everyone. Because, at the end of the day, being Bosca means to explore. Like real pioneers. This is exactly what Luigiterzo has done in the recent past, leading Bosca across the border to the most remote places of the Old Continent. And beyond. At the beginning of the 19th century, Carlo did the same thing, establishing the company’s US branch and becoming widely known as Mister Moscato. Before him, in the mid-1800s, it was Luigi Bosca's mission. To export his wines on steamships across the Atlantic and bring them to the Italians who had emigrated to America. Even further back in time: a man with his hands covered in soil. He is sitting in front of the notary in Canelli signing the deed of incorporation of his wine company. The name at the bottom of the document reads: Pietro Bosca. The year is 1831. The year when it all started."

So he founded in Casoria, industrial area in Naples, a small roasting coffee company, called “Caffè Moreno”, owing only one roaster machine with a capacity of 60 kg. He was only twenty-four years old when he began his entrepreneurial career, managing on the front line both the commercial and administrative phases with the collaboration of only two employees. At the beginning of the 70s, the increasing sale volume led to the decision to equip a new roaster four times bigger than previously used, after ten years of his activity, the number of employees has increased tenfold and the considerable quantity of ten quintals of coffee weekly sold. In the 80s he involved his four sons in different business area, teaching them the various phases of business management and training those who, today, together with him, are the cornerstones of the company's activity. The activity started in the “HO.RE.CA” channel during the 1960s, with the first deliveries to the most prestigious cafes in the city of Naples. In 1996, he felt that something was changing in the market regarding the use of coffee and following the demands of families and office workers, the company gave life to the first production of pods with the acquisition of new machinery. Today the company produces 5 single dose lines, including : Pods, Fap caps, and Nespresso compatible, A modo mio and Dolcegusto. In addition to single serve doses, Caffè Moreno produces, for the “vending channel”, some particular coffee blends for automatic coffee vending machines."

He acquired from a local businessman, a small handmade biscuit producing factory in Dehiwala. What was founded by Simon Arthur Wickramasingha with just 10 employees known as ‘Williams Confectionaries’ back then, was mechanized in 1957 with UK’s Baker Perkins lines. The humble beginnings of CBL, a family business, now run by its third generation, stems from the notion of ‘caring.’ CBL first launched its flagship Munchee brand in 1968. It was the time when CARE USA was looking for sources to support its national mid-day meal programme for school children. Mineka Wickramasingha rose to the need in partnership with CARE and the Ministry of Education by developing its ground breaking high-protein Munchee brand of biscuits to supplement the ‘cup of milk and a bun’ given by the CARE as a school mid-day meal . A more spacious factory premises being a prerequisite for this purpose, Mineka put up the present biscuit factory on an eight acre plot of land in Pannipitiya. The high protein biscuit, made in-house using bread flour, soya bean oil and milk powder, was an ideal accompaniment to the afternoon meal for school children. Soon, Munchee biscuits became a household name Ceylon Biscuits Limited is Sri Lanka’s largest manufacturer and exporter of Biscuits, Wafers, Chocolates, Snacks and Textured Soy products. CBL began its exports with biscuits in 1971 but its beginnings are in 1968, when Mineka Wickramasingha developed and proposed a unique recipe for a protein enriched biscuit that would resolve the nutrition inadequacies of school meal supplement at the time."

At the time, this was the largest investment in the juice industry in Greece. We invested, renovated it and added two new state of the art processing plants: A juicing plant for squeezing the citrus crop and a bottling plant that operates under fully sterilized conditions. Chios Gardens continues to uphold the timeless talent of the islanders to produce exceptional products that travel the world. Our juices are made from the best quality fruit and we work very hard to make everything perfect. We squeeze the best fruit and only the volume we need.

Halloumi is a traditional Cyprus cheese dating back centuries. It is a semi-hard cheese, prepared from a blend of cow, sheep and goat milk and flavoured with dried mint. Somis Dairy was established in 1941. In 2004 the 2nd and 3rd generations of Somis’ family proceeded with the construction of a new factory where they were destined to write a new chapter in halloumi history. Their experience, eagerness, passion, and love for halloumi production resulted in them becoming one of the major exporters of halloumi in Cyprus. It is important to note that our Halloumi has been repeatedly awarded with the Superior Taste award from the “International Taste & Quality Institute” in Brussels and was ultimately the first exporter of PDO Halloumi to Europe in October 2021. In 2022, the company transitioned smoothly to new management which was created by the merging of two Associations of Farmers, Enak and MPOAI. Fontana, the largest importer of Mediterranean products in Scandinavia, also participated in the merge to create the new structure called 3F Fair Farm Family Ltd. Through this structure, Somis Dairy ensures secure stability for the highest levels of quality of its main ingredient, fresh milk. It is the secret behind full fulling the quality expectations of Sweden, known for the highest standards worldwide. With a strong foundation of relevant history, knowledge, and experience, aligned with the empowerment of high-targeting new leadership, Somis Halloumi is a leader in the market. The final product exceeds all expectations. Our Best-Selling Halloumi’s success is a reflection of customer loyalty derived from their pure satisfaction."

Daily Dairy Holland B.V.,Hall: Hall 1 Stand: G1-41,"Huizermaatweg 550-D ,Huizen ,Noord-Holland ,1276 KS ,Netherlands ",http://www.daily-dairy.com,,,,,,"Cheese is in our heritage. One of our owners' grandfather was a cheese porter and sold his cheese door to door in Huizen back in 1900. Since then it has never disappeared from the family. In the 1970s and 80s, large cheese wheels were still cut in mother's kitchen and the boys went on selling them. It all has to do with the village we grew up in: Huizen, in the beautiful surroundings of 't Gooi. By the early 20th century, many fishermen were forced to abandon the fishing because of the construction of the Afsluitdijk (Enclosure Dam). The inner sea of the Zuiderzee became the IJsselmeer (Lake ?ssel) and the fishery came to an end. The people from Huizen are entrepreneurs and love to travel. So, they developed a flourishing trade in cheese in The Netherlands and an ever-growing export to houses in Germany and Belgium. Daily Dairy Holland today is young and dynamic but has a solid foundation of knowledge and experience in cheese and dairy. Our current diverse team has accumulated many years of experience and our products are to be found in over 70 countries. In the world of cheese, we consider ourselves to be the odd one out. This is because we highly value personal attention and strive for excellent customer service and satisfaction. Besides this, it has come to our attention that consumers wish to experience something unique and exciting once in a while. We respond to this by experimenting with ingredients, focussing on innovation and striving for excellence. What once began as ideas, have now developed to being some of our most popular products. Through continuous innovation and our focus on the trends of tomorrow, we are dedicated to present many more novelties in the years to come."

Our facilities are based of a farm with a capacity for 12.500 lambs and also a modern slaughterhouse only 6 years old with a cutting room. The fact that we have a vertical structure from the farm to the slaughterhouse and cutting room, allow us to control the entire process on a way to guarantee quality and the traceability of our product. The lambs that we work with are only from spanish breeds, mainly ¨Manchega¨ and¨Merinos¨, which we bring from the country side and more isolated areas of Spain, perfect and more appropriated for the extensive livestock farming. Initially they stay in the farms from origin and during the first month they feed only milk, and then until two or two months and a half they combine the milk with the cereal flour (in this phase they are mono gastric). From that point on, they become ruminants and it’s when we bring them to our farm in Barcelona where they feed our specific formula based on hay and grain cereal until slaughter. We slaughter animals 3 to 4 months old, they are young and healthy animals which will bring us a really premium quality."

Until 1985, the company deals exclusively with olive oil. From that year, the sons of Il. Foufas, George and Othonas, enter the company and the second phase of its development begins. With continuous investments, of which the two main took place in 1987 and 1990, the company initially gains nationwide fame and then expands to foreign markets. At the same time, it expands its product line to include a wide variety of seed oils. In 2012, the third generation actively enters the business and a new cycle of investments begins. The company greatly expands its clientele in foreign countries and at the same time, it strengthens its collaborations in Greece, which are the solid foundations for its further development."

Whole or Broken Kernels: Used in baked goods, candy, granolas and bars. Meal and Flour: Grain-free and gluten-free alternative enhances flavor as well as nutritional value. Diced: Provides an even distribution of the nut for uniform flavor, texture and appearance. Sliced: Thinly sliced to add rich flavor, garnish and crunch. Oil: Cold pressed, unfiltered and unrefined used as an alternative to olive and other cooking oils. Paste and Butter: Varieties include 100 percent hazelnut spread or with inclusions such as sugar. Inshell: Enjoy the traditional experience. The Oregon hazelnut industry is in the midst of the biggest growth period in its history. Since 2011, total acres of hazelnut trees planted in Oregon have nearly tripled to over 90,000.

I was amazed by the world of bees. Creating a bee colony and monitoring the way this world grows and survives, was something truly spectacular. Without a beekeeping heritage running in our family, I had to learn the old-fashioned way. This meant helping former, experienced beekeepers. In this way, I was able to closely observe the process of integrated production and I was by far more fascinated by the process of beekeeping. I was also able to realize the way a product is created from scratch, and, even more, the way I can achieve this, in collaboration with nature! Later on, in my 20s (2015), I decided that this should be my main occupation. In order to achieve this, I attended a series of courses and seminars on beekeeping, of ered by the Beekeeping Laboratory of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, along with my studies in Agricultural Technology. After 9 years of commitment and having the necessary expertise in the field, our team manages to produce honey in suf icient quantity and is always driven by excellent quality. Our need for evolution and our external thoughts resulted in the creation of a new brand, which goes by the name of “Philomelia ” (2020). A brand that from the very first moment was welcomed and embraced by the local community and was also distinguished in an international and acknowledged tasting competition conducted in England (Great Taste Awards). At the same time, we are currently constructing our new honey packing plant, which will complete our journey of production. From day one till today, everything has fitted together perfectly. In slow, but steady steps we walk our way into our dreams and look towards the future with great optimism."

This paves its way to an easy market dominance. At the moment, PSL is proud to be the only company in Vietnam with the ability to source from Africa. It is because we own representative offices and warehouses on this continent, in Tanzania, Nigeria, and Ivory Coast for specific. Aside from experts sent from the headquarters, almost all of the employees there are the locals, who comprehend their homeland, helping us access regions where cashews are grown in the best conditions. Moreover, instead of trading via brokers, we buy raw cashews directly from farmers, which allows us to not only better control the input but also offer the farmers the best price. The best success that PSL has achieved since establishment is probably the development of a fully vertical integrated supply chain. The whole process, from sourcing, storage, transporting to manufacturing and distributing is closely managed by our collaborators. This is the firm ground for us to pursue the target of full traceability for each and every product by 2025. At the same time, the company puts emphasis on ESG investing.

Globally, we currently export to the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Australia, Korea Republic, Qatar, the USA, France, Spain and Germany.

Gran Regale brand and product description: Valio Gran Regale cheese: result of Estonian-Italian synergy Imagine combining the best hard cheese making know-how with one of the purest environments in Europe. This exceptional meeting happened in the late 90´s, when Võru cheese plant was visited by one of the largest Italian producers of Parmigiano Reggiano and Grana Padano; they discovered the Estonian qualitative, pure milk. The result of this unique synergy was a true success: Forte hard cheese was born. Later, it was even offered at Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. Sales grew steadily all over Europe and not only – the biggest achievement has been Italy becoming our largest export market. What better testament to our cheese’s taste and quality. Following the positive wave, investments were made to develop a new great product with a white grainy structure, vibrant flavour and mildly pungent smell: Gran Regale. Valio Gran Regale’s production follows what the original Italian tradition demands: 33 kg wheels are placed on wooden shelves where they undergo a long maturation of minimum 10 months"

The ultimate goal is to create delicious and healthy products, while having a minimal environmental impact with little to no waste.

From a culinary aspect they can be used for flavouring salads, meals, some are even good for frying and baking. Many of them are highly sought-after cosmetic oils, due to their exeptional skincare components. The Grapoila oil range includes more than 20 kinds of cold-pressed oils. Meeting today’s demands for environmental-friendly production Grapoila has developed own green technology to make the best use of byproducts and minimize waste. The first residues developed during oil pressing are the the pellets, that will be milled, sieved and sold as seed flours. They are perfect sources of vegan protein, water-soluble vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. They are excellent gluten-free substitutes to withe wheat flour in any health conscious diet, and valuable baking ingredients. Another valuable residue of the oil production is the settled, thick oil mud available after the filtering of the oil. According to the features of the seeds, their oil muds can be used as delicious gourmet butters on their own, or as base material for natural cosmetics, gourmet creams or sauces.
